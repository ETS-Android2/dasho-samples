# _PreEmptive Protection - DashO_ Samples

This repository contains samples that demonstrate using [PreEmptive Protection - DashO](https://www.preemptive.com/products/dasho/).
The samples use either [Ant](http://ant.apache.org) or [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org).
All samples will need to know the location where DashO is installed (i.e. `DASHO_HOME`).
Each sample has its own README with any setup and/or configuration instructions.

The samples are categorized by type:

* [Android&trade;](android/README.md) - Samples demonstrating DashO with Android projects.
  * A separate [DashO-GameOfLife](https://github.com/preemptive/DashO-GameOfLife) sample showing a more-complex Android app that includes a library is also available.
* [Java](java/README.md) - Samples demonstrating DashO with basic Java applications.
* [Shelf Life](shelflife/README.md) - Samples demonstrating DashO's Shelf Life with basic Java applications.
